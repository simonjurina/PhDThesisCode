// The file IsHyperbolicAuxiliaryCode contains sub-routines of IsHyperbolic that are used by
// IsConjugate and VerifyHypVertex. Copy them before using the code of IsConjugate or VerifyHypVertex.

// The desriptions of sub-routines and tests are included in the corresponding files. One thing to note is 
// that IsConjugate returns the cyclically \mathcal{P}-reduced conjugates of the input words and the correspoding 
// conjugating word in lists so that it is possible to distinguish them.
